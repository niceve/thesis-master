# Abstract {.unnumbered}

This thesis focuses on the design and implementation of a software-defined radio (SDR) platform for spectrum monitoring and analysis. The objective of the project is to provide a low-cost and scalable solution for real-time spectrum analysis and visualization. The project is based on open source technology and is aimed at being accessible and usable by individuals, businesses, and organizations which may need to monitor and understand the usage of the radio spectrum in remote locations.

This thesis consists of three logical macro-sections. The first section of the thesis provides an overview of software-defined radio technology and its role in modern radio communication systems. This includes a discussion of the hardware and software components used in SDR systems, as well as the algorithms and techniques employed to perform real-time spectrum analysis and visualization.

The second part of the thesis focuses on the design and implementation of the open source project \enquote{OpenRFSense}, which was created and maintained by the author of this thesis. This section focuses mainly on the engineering of the various software components which comprise the project and the way such components are integrated.

Finally, the thesis evaluates the performance and accuracy of the SDR platform and its ability to provide a low-cost and scalable solution for spectrum monitoring and analysis. The conclusion provides recommendations for future work, including ways to further improve the accuracy and performance of the platform, as well as potential applications for similar SDR-powered software in various fields, such as wireless networking and radio communication systems.

Overall, this thesis aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the design and implementation of an SDR platform for spectrum monitoring and analysis, as well as a useful example of an accessible, open source software suite.
