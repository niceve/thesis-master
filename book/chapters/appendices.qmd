# Code structure
All the code for the OpenRFSense project is hosted on Github, a free Git repository hosting service with additional code and community management tools. At the time of writing, the various components are placed in the following repositories under the [OpenRFSense organization](https://github.com/openrfsense):

* `backend`: source code and tooling for the backend service
* `node`: source code and tooling for the node management software
* `orfs-sensor`: source code for the signal recording software
* `image`: various scripts and tooling to generate the pre-configured system image for Raspberry Pi boards
* `openrfsense.github.io`: technical documentation for the project (see [Appendix @sec-techDoc])
* `common`: shared code which would otherwise be duplicated in both node and backend

# Project branding
Special care was put behind giving an identity to the OpenRFSense project through graphic design. A simple but meaningful logo contains the abbreviated project name and a round symbology reminiscent of WiFi-associated commercial products.

The color palette has enough contrast to be accessible but maintains at least one saturated color.

# Technical documentation {#sec-techDoc}
All software components for the OpenRFSense project contain self-documenting code with numerous comments and additional language-specific documentation tooling (`godoc`). Moreover, additional user-oriented technical documentation has been written and is deployed automatically on Github's static file hosting service (Github Pages).

The documentation is written in Markdown format and is rendered to a static website using the Jekyll program. It includes code blocks with ready-to-use examples to prepare deployments and configure the services before starting the system, together with overviews of the various components. All pages also feature a search widget which facilitates navigation through the text contents.
