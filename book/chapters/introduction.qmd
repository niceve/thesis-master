# Introduction
Dit is intro
The collection and analysis of data samples from the radio frequency spectrum has always required considerable effort, even with partial automation, due to the inherent complexity and density of such data. Furthermore, complex systems based on analogic circuits were needed to process radio signals. This used to entail large investments in both manpower and capital at any scale, making spectrum analysis infeasible for hobbyists.

This thesis will elaborate on the potential of SDR technology and the value of open source software in advancing the field of radio communication systems.

## Background and motivation
Software-defined radio (SDR) is a technology that has been gaining attention in recent years due to its ability to revolutionize the way we design and operate radio communication systems. The history of SDR technology can be traced back to the 1980s, when advances in digital signal processing (DSP) made it possible to perform signal processing in software. At that time, SDR was still in its early stages, and the hardware technology available was limited. In the early 1990s, the first SDR prototypes were developed [@mitolaSoftwareRadiossurveyCritical1992], and the technology began to be used in military and defense applications.

As the technology progressed, the cost of digital signal processors and memory decreased, and software became more advanced. This allowed for the development of more modern SDR systems which could support a wider range of radio communication protocols and waveforms. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, SDR technology began to be adopted in the commercial sector for applications such as wireless networking and cellular communication systems.

Today, SDR technology is being used in a wide range of applications, from amateur radio to satellite communication systems, and is increasingly becoming more accessible to the general public. SDR technology is a key enabler for emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G communication systems. The potential benefits of SDR technology are significant, including greater flexibility, reduced development time and cost, and improved spectrum utilization.

In today's world, radio frequency (RF) communication is the backbone of many critical infrastructures, with applications ranging from wireless networking to cellular communication systems. However, the increasing demand for wireless communication has led to a shortage of available spectrum, which can lead to interference and other problems. With this in mind, the motivation behind developing the OpenRFsense project is to create an experimental solution using modern SDR technologies for real-time spectrum monitoring and analysis.

## Project overview
The OpenRFSense project leverages a small, high-availability application (\enquote{node}) running on low-power devices (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computers) equipped with a SDR module and a backend service which provides centralized storage and remote control capabilities over said hardware.

The node application is designed to start on boot and run as long as the device is powered on. It's responsible for communicating useful data to the backend service on demand (such as device telemetry and radio spectrum recordings) and provide a web-based management interface aimed at facilitating normal device configuration without requiring external peripherals to be attached.

The backend service is responsible for receiving and storing spectrum data, while also providing a web-based user interface (UI). The service exposes a REST [@fieldingArch2000] interface to make data accessible to external services, while the UI allows users to manage the stored data and explore it by visualizing a playback of the recorded radio spectrum.

## Related work
In recent years many SDR-powered projects have been created to monitor the spectrum in real time. One of such projects is Electrosense [@rajendranElectrosenseOpenBig2018], developed independently by a team of researchers. Electrosense is a commercial product which includes a web-based visualization interface for spectrum data and receives such data by means of a custom-designed SDR board attached to a Raspberry Pi computer.

Another similar but simpler project is OpenWebRX [@retzlerOpenWebRXWebbasedSoftware2018], another web-based spectrum visualization platform which mainly focuses on real-time audiovisual analysis of data through a waterfall plot and noise sampling. The OpenWebRX project only supports visualizing a single data source at a time, but provides a free directory listing of all public machines which provide radio data and a hyperlink leading to their web interface.
